# Dating-App
In this code the program defines a User class to represent users of the dating app. Each user has two properties:

name: The user's name.
sexuality: The user's sexuality preference (e.g., "Heterosexual," "Homosexual," or "Bisexual").
User List: The code creates a list called users to store sample user profiles. These profiles include names and sexuality preferences. In a real dating app, these profiles would typically contain more information, such as photos, descriptions, and other details.

User Input: The program uses a Scanner object to get input from the user. It prompts the user to enter their sexuality preference by displaying a message: "Enter your sexuality (Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual): ".

Matching Algorithm: After receiving the user's input, the program displays a list of potential matches. It iterates through the users list and checks if each user's sexuality preference matches the user's input. If there's a match, the user's name is displayed as a potential match.

Displaying Matches: The program prints the names of potential matches on the console, and they are displayed with a bullet point ("-"). If there are no matches based on the user's preference, no names are displayed.

Conclusion Message: Finally, the program prints a thank-you message for using the dating app.
